Spatial CIELAB (S-CIELAB) is a set of Matlab routines that extend the CIELAB color matrix to patterned inputs.

For a general introduction to S-CIELAB, please see:

This repository is the first implementation of S-CIELAB, and it dates from 1998 (X. Zhang and B. Wandell).  The code has been updated as part of the ISET software system from Imageval, LLC.  Various other groups have described proposed changes.

Spatial CIELAB is designed around principles of human vision. For tutorials on human vision, please see:
